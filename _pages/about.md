Hi, I'm Max. I'm a postdoc workin on machine learning and robotics problems.

I am a postdoc at the [University of Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de/), where I am co-supervised by [Thomas Brox](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/brox/index.en.html) and [Abhinav Valada](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/people/valada). My PhD was supervised by Thomas Brox and [Wolfram Burgard](https://www.utn.de/person/wolfram-burgard-2/). Prior to my doctorate I obtained a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Physics at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) under [Bj√∂rn Ommer](https://ommer-lab.com/people/ommer/).

Over the course of my PhD and postdoc, I have worked on computer vision for robotic manipulation, exploring approaches ranging from reinforcement learning to visual servoing.  Additionally, I have investigated self-supervised learning and hand pose estimation.

Most recently, I am working to build few-shot robot imitation systems that are able to learn from human demonstrations, as well as designing robotics algorithms that easily generalize to different application settings. I have also published several articles in the field of explainable AI.

I have completed a research internship at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) under the guidance of [Evan Shelhammer](http://imaginarynumber.net/) and at Symbio Robotics together with Jon Long, and published work from both internships.
